# Brain-Tumor-Classification

Brain Tumor is the uncontrollable and irregular growth of the cells in the human brain. With the passage of time, these cells continue to multiply. To classify brain tumor, a CNN method is proposed for accurately classifying brain tumours, and the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are tested for improving CNN model's accuracy utilising characteristics derived from the CNN model.
